Foster</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;As I've mentioned in class, there will be no scheduled class period on Thursday, September 4. I've already recorded and posted a lecture for that day on the &lt;a href="/course-mat/"&gt;Course Materials&lt;/a&gt; page. Registered students with &lt;a href="//utexas.instructure.com/courses/1119539/" target="blank_"&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt; access will now notice that an &lt;a href="//utexas.instructure.com/courses/1119539/quizzes/1038905/" target="blank_"&gt;assignment&lt;/a&gt; has been posted.&lt;br&gt;The assignment is to watch the video lecture and take a very short quiz before class on 09/09/2014. The quiz is extremely simple and the material is explicitly from the lecture. It is only intended to enforce that you watch the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be several of these quizzes throughout the semester. The total percentage of correct answers for all quiz grades will count as 1 homework assignment in the overall grading structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>/posts/lecture-quiz-assigned.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2014 13:36:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Course Materials Page</title><link>/posts/course-materials-page.html</link><dc:creator>John T. Foster</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;You will notice in the navigation bar a &lt;a href="/course-mat/"&gt;Course Materials&lt;/a&gt; tab now. This is where I will post the lecture PDFs and recordings as well as any additional course reference material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the recorded lectures, I have clipped them into topical subsections and posted them to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL2qLznO3_oa-6MMxFmlpg" target="blank_"&gt;Course YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;. Clicking the posted link will take you to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL2qLznO3_oa-6MMxFmlpg/playlists" target="blank_"&gt;YouTube Playlist&lt;/a&gt; that will play the individual clips from that lecture in the sequence they were delivered. Feel free to watch/review only the clips that are of interest to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaFDhoncLBU&amp;amp;list=PLyQr4689RR7BNP9HEMbiJeB2vA2ZrD4Pp" target="blank_"&gt;first lecture&lt;/a&gt; there was a little background noise in the audio of first the first few clips. I believe I know what was causing this and will work to correct it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>/posts/course-materials-page.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2014 16:41:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Welcome!</title><link>/posts/welcome.html</link><dc:creator>John T.
