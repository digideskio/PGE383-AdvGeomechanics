Foster</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The midterm exam is scheduled to take place as a take-home exam on Thursday and Friday, 10/16-10/17. The exam will cover all lecture material through Thursday 10/9, but of course, will focus on concepts from the 3 homework assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the format of the exam is take-home. It will be assigned at 9:30 AM Thursday, 10/16 via &lt;a href="https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1119539"&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt; and is due by 5 PM 10/17. The test can be turned in by hand-delivering the completed exam to my proxy, &lt;a href="mailto:jogrady@gmail.com"&gt;Mr. James O'Grady&lt;/a&gt; who is located CPE 3.104. He will likely be in this office all day, but has been instructed to be certain to be available between 3 and 5 PM on 10/17. Alternatively, you can scan your exam worksheets and submit the exam on the course &lt;a href="https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1119539"&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt; site by 5 PM on 10/17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are allowed any resource (e.g. books, notes, web) to complete the exam except consultation with another student or professor. You are reminded of the &lt;a href="http://www.utexas.edu/about-ut/mission-core-purpose-honor-code"&gt;UT Student Honor Code&lt;/a&gt;, violations of academic integrity with be &lt;a href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_reportingprocedures.php"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>/posts/midterm-exam-scheduled.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 19:15:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Assignment 3 Posted</title><link>/posts/assignment-3-posted.html</link><dc:creator>John T.

I did not have time to record this Thursday's (10/2/2014) lecture before I left on travel so I will make up this lecture at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class will be held as scheduled on 10/7/2014 and this is a reminder that your &lt;a href="http://johntfoster.github.io/PGE383-AdvGeomechanics/files/assignment2.pdf"&gt;Homework Assignment #2&lt;/a&gt; is due at the beginning of class.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>/posts/930-lecture-and-quiz-posted.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 14:12:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Assignment 2 Posted</title><link>/posts/assignment-2-posted.html</link><dc:creator>John T.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 09/23/2014&lt;/strong&gt;: Solution posted &lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/johntfoster/PGE383-AdvGeomechanics/blob/master/files/assignment1_solution.ipynb" target="blank_"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>/posts/assignment-1-posted.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2014 18:54:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Lecture Quiz assigned</title><link>/posts/lecture-quiz-assigned.html</link><dc:creator>John T. Foster</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;As I've mentioned in class, there will be no scheduled class period on Thursday, September 4. I've already recorded and posted a lecture for that day on the &lt;a href="/course-mat/"&gt;Course Materials&lt;/a&gt; page. Registered students with &lt;a href="//utexas.instructure.com/courses/1119539/" target="blank_"&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt; access will now notice that an &lt;a href="//utexas.instructure.com/courses/1119539/quizzes/1038905/" target="blank_"&gt;assignment&lt;/a&gt; has been posted.&lt;br&gt;The assignment is to watch the video lecture and take a very short quiz before class on 09/09/2014. The quiz is extremely simple and the material is explicitly from the lecture. It is only intended to enforce that you watch the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be several of these quizzes throughout the semester. The total percentage of correct answers for all quiz grades will count as 1 homework assignment in the overall grading structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>/posts/lecture-quiz-assigned.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2014 13:36:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Course Materials Page</title><link>/posts/course-materials-page.html</link><dc:creator>John T. Foster</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;You will notice in the navigation bar a &lt;a href="/course-mat/"&gt;Course Materials&lt;/a&gt; tab now. This is where I will post the lecture PDFs and recordings as well as any additional course reference material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the recorded lectures, I have clipped them into topical subsections and posted them to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL2qLznO3_oa-6MMxFmlpg" target="blank_"&gt;Course YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;. Clicking the posted link will take you to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL2qLznO3_oa-6MMxFmlpg/playlists" target="blank_"&gt;YouTube Playlist&lt;/a&gt; that will play the individual clips from that lecture in the sequence they were delivered. Feel free to watch/review only the clips that are of interest to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaFDhoncLBU&amp;amp;list=PLyQr4689RR7BNP9HEMbiJeB2vA2ZrD4Pp" target="blank_"&gt;first lecture&lt;/a&gt; there was a little background noise in the audio of first the first few clips. I believe I know what was causing this and will work to correct it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>/posts/course-materials-page.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2014 16:41:49 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
